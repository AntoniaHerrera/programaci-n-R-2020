A textbook that teaches R and the `tidyverse` from scratch using examples from Latin American political science. It was [published by CRC Press (Routledge)](https://www.routledge.com/R-for-Political-Data-Science-A-Practical-Guide/Urdinez-Cruz/p/book/9780367818890) in November 2020. The Spanish version is open-access and [freely available online](https://arcruz0.github.io/libroadp/).

An R package to supervise fuzzy joins, i.e. a way to solve the common problem of non-standardized ID variables when joining data sets. A recording of my presentation about it at the Toronto Data Workshop on Reproducibility (2021) is [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjdPDEACxmA).
